## What Didn't Work
-Making button that switched the two links, it would switch but could not get the word "switched" to show up
-Certain codes not showing up/running in jupyter notebooks
-Sprite not showing up/moving too fast

## What Worked
-Simple hacks on web development like making arrays, lists, and using if statments
-Changing the speed of my sprite (once it showed up)

## how I fixed it!
-With the switched problem I went of chat GPT to ask for clarification and checked with my teammates and finallly figured out that I can use an if statment essentially saying "if the links are switched, say switched"

-For the sprite I realized the problem after I restated, when I changed the varrible names I acidently did not capitalize a few of them resulting in my code not running.

-For the codes not showing up in jupter notebooks I checked with my teacher and asked peers and TA's what they did/what worked for them.  I realized the code worked in my local host server but not in jupyter notebooks,  and if that didnt work making it a post also worked

## learned
When codding the web programing basics I ran into many problems with jupyter notebooks
-I learned what diffrent errors ment (like syntax errors/formating errors/ specific errors)
-I learned how to create buttons that function and do something
-I learned about the if statments
-I learned mathematical functions in html/javascript
-I learned how to make a sprite/how to change the values and what values correlate with what part of the sprite
