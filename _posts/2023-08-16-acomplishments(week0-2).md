## Summary of my Accomplishments (weeks 0-2 mixed up)

##### learning to change index.md/homepage
- learned how to use markdown and reviewed newly learned markdwon commands with my partners (how to add immages, change background colors, make a hedding, etc.) <br>

##### 1st time commiting troubles
- had trouble commiting my changes (would not give me acsess) fixed this problem by making a personalized acsess token on github and using that to commit instead <br>

##### adding table
- went above and beyond by added a table  to the homepage with plans and goals for the week <br>

##### notebook
- created a notes/notebook file to write down things to remeber and things that I learned <br>

##### familiarizing with coding languadges
- re-learned/remebered how to change things with css, html, and markdown (things including adding immages, changing colors, and changing blog pages) <br>

##### familiarizing with slack/how to use it
- Added myself to slack and got fimilular with it by reading teachers posts, and sharing images shared with my group members <br>

##### commits not working/token useage
- had issues with my commits not going through on git hub (build error) was not working
 --> to solve this I had to fork the repository so that it would be my own repository and not the nighthack coders <br>

##### sync to/with github
- had trouble syncing to github.  To solve this  had to re-signin and sync my account again to get it to work <br>

##### snake game
- when coding in the snake game I wanted to figure out how to change the background/border/and snake/snake food.
--> since I hadent used HTML for 2 years and there was almost 400 lines of code it wqas hard to find the specific peices and parts to change. it took about 27-30ish minutes of tweeking and retesting and trying new thingsa new colors but I figured out how to change it!<br>
