### Installing Hacks (strugles)
followed along with the teacher durring the lectures/live instructions.  at first I had an issue with cloning the right repository (I did not fork it/rename it the right name/clone the right repository)

### GitHub Account
made a github account with my personal email and synced it with my vscode. (had troubole using git.config and configuring my email and username as it would only show my username.  because of this it was not letting me commit for a little)
 --> to fix this I asked for help from peers and TA's and learned that I configed my email incorectlry and figured out how to do it right!
