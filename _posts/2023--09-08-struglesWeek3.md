## Summary of my Accomplishments (week 3)

###### Adding emoji to snake game
when trying to add the emoji to the snake game we ran into several problems.  we wanted to add it but with cloud computers you cannot copy and paste the emoji into your code 

to battle this we made a "circle" using an arc and colored it red to mimic an apple

after this we input it into the code but realized that the "food" and the "snake" were connected and we needed to make another function to seperate the two (still working on that..)

###### changing arrow keys to WASD in snake game

after studyingusing chat GPT we figured out the keys used ASCII and after using that knowlage we were able to change keys from arrows to WASD!
